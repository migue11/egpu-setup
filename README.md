# eGPU Setup
**eGPU Setup** for Mac is a user-friendly native macOS application written in **Swift**. **eGPU Setup** encompasses the eGPU community's techniques to enable external GPUs on all thunderbolt Macs, use unsupported external GPUs, and force applications to use external GPUs for *computation and rendering*.

## Basic Requirements
**eGPU Setup**, due to its nature of patches, requires:
- **macOS**: High Sierra (10.13.4+) or later
- **System Integrity Protection**: Must be disabled completely
- **Apple Boot Security**: Disabled completely

## Features
**eGPU Setup** is a high-fidelity macOS application that includes the following capabilities:
- Support for **AMD** or **NVIDIA** eGPUs
- Support for *all* thunderbolt Macs
- Support for *all* external GPU enclosures
- Unified application eGPU preference management system
- Software updates, troubleshooting, & additional support provisions
- eGPU notification system for additional steps for edge-case machines
- Menubar application for eGPU status monitoring

## User Interface
The setup process is *straight-forward, autonomous, and simple*. Every application page is descriptive & informative, with the ability to read more of what's happening & some tips & tricks for a seamless experience. The following procedures are automated:
- System configuration detection
- eGPU configuration detection
- System application eGPU preference detection

### eGPU Setup Introduction
- Retrieves your system configuration
- Retrieves your current system patch status
- Determines compatibility and edge cases

### eGPU Preferences Manager
- Fetches all applications in *expected* locations
- Allows performing a deeper scan for other applications
- Allows setting/unsetting the eGPU preference for one or more applications
- Allows easy set/reset of eGPU preference for all applications

### eGPU Uninstallation
- Briefs the user on the uninstallation process
- Provides a *safe* general uninstallation mechanism
- Provides an option to uninstall *all* components, with fair warning
- Performs uninstallation with verification & system integrity checks

### eGPU Installation
- Automatically determines your eGPU configuration
- Allows manual adjustments for configuration settings as needed
- Provides an option for direct kernel patching or in-memory on-the-fly
- Performs a validated system patch
- Installs the **eGPU Setup Recovery Tool CLI** for recovery in **Single User Mode**

## System Patches
The following is a summary of system patches required for macs based on the system configuration and eGPU vendor.

## AMD eGPUs
All patches leverage the native AMD eGPU acceleration functionality. Additional patches are needed for older AMD eGPUs such as the **R9 Fury**, and some modern GPUs that Apple has not enabled support for, such as the **RX 560**.

### Thunderbolt
- **Thunderbolt 1/2**: Require the **AppleGPUWrangler Thunderbolt** patch for full native support. **AMDUnofficialSupport.kext** also required for older AMD GPUs.
- **Thunderbolt 3**: **AMDUnofficialSupport.kext** required for older AMD GPUs. Modern GPUs are natively supported and require no patches.

### Problematic Systems
- **Discrete NVIDIA GPUs**: Such macs have problems rendering on an external AMD GPU. A workaround is included, but has compromises at this time.
- **Old AMD eGPUs**: Not all older AMD GPUs may work. A workaround is included to attempt acceleration.

## NVIDIA eGPUs
All macs require system patches to enable NVIDIA eGPUs at this time. Patches support hot-plugging and booting with the eGPU plugged in, and any Thunderbolt version, but there are a variety of complications involved. The patches auto-bypass thunderbolt limitations.

### Limitations
- **Hot-Disconnect**: Not possible with the current patching mechanism. Doing so will crash the system. The menubar eGPU ejection system is also disabled.
- **Discrete AMD GPUs**: Such macs require additional steps to achieve good UI performance.
